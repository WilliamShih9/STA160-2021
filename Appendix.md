# Appendix

All relevant figures are included here. These plots are very high resolution (300 dpi), much higher resolution than ones in the Jupyter Notebook file (Midterm_Project.ipynb). 

Some chart not formatted correctly. Can be found on https://github.com/WilliamShih9/STA160-2021/tree/main/PlotsFinalProject
